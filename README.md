This is a companion repository to
[GETTSIM](https://github.com/iza-institute-of-labor-economics/gettsim-code-for-picking)
containing code that does not have a clear place over there. Examples may include ideas
for toying around or outdated code, which might come back but is too much of a burden to
maintain.

Initially, this repository contained
- the bokeh-based dashboard, which will be re-written in plotly/dash and might be moved
  to a separate repository.
- a set of tests of Lohnsteuer against the German Minsitry of Finance's API, which is
  not sufficiently stable over time to keep the tests as a component of GETTSIM proper.
